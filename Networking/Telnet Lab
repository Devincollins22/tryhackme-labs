Telnet Lab Notes:
- Telnet is a protocol to connect remotely to servers via TCP, allowing text commands to be sent and received
- It operates on different ports depending on the service:
      - Echo server - port 7
      - Daytime server - port 13
      - HTTP (web) server - port 80
- Using Telnet to connect:
  - Command format: telnet [IP adress] [port]
  - Example: telnet 10.10.122.74 7 connects to the Echo server
- Echo server:
    - Echoes back everything you send.
    - Useful to test conncectivit
    - Not secure, typically diabled in production
- Daytime server:
    - Returns current date and time
    - Connection closes after sending the response
- HTTP server:
  - Use telnet to manually send an HTTP request
    - Send GET / HTTP/1.1 and specif a Host: header
    - Press Entire twice after the request 
    - The server responds with HTTP headers and webpage content.
    - Response contains server information (name and version).


Telnet Exercise - TryHackMe
- Start the AttackBox and target machine; wait ~2 mins for both to boot.
- Use telnet <target-ip> <port> to connect to services on the target machine.

Tested three servers:
- Echo server (port 7): echoes back sent text.
- Daytime server (port 13): sends current date/time, then closes connection.
- HTTP server (port 80): serves webpages, accepts HTTP commands.

To connect to HTTP server:
- Use telnet 10.10.122.74 80

Send HTTP request:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: telnet.thm

(Note the blank line after Host header)

Server response contains HTTP headers and page content.

Extracted HTTP server info: lighttpd/1.4.63

Found flag on the webpage: THM{TELNET_MASTER}

Exit telnet using CTRL + ] then quit
