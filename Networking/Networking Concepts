OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model: Going Over the 7 Layers

Layer 1 - Physical Layer:

The Physical Layer is the first layer of the OSI model and it deals with the acutal hardware used to send data, like cables, swiitches, and radio signals.
It's all about how the 1s and 0s(binary data) travel from one comptuer to another using electrical or light signals. This layer covers things like ethernet cables, 
fiber optics, and Wifi signals. If there's a problem with your cable, plug, of Wifi signal, it's probably a Physical Layer issue. It doesn't care about what the data 
is just how it moves from point A to point B.

Layer 2 - Data Link:

The Data Link Layer is all about making sure data gets to the right place on a local network and without errors. It takes the raw bits from the physical layer and organizes
them into frames, which are like small packages of data. It also helps fix basic errors and decides which devices can talk on the network at what time.
This layer usues MAC addresses (Unique IDs for Devices) to help send data to the correct computer. Think of it like a teacher calling on one student at a time so 
everyone can speak clearly.

Layer 3 - Network Layer:

The Network Layer is in charge of finding the best way to send data from one computer to another, even if they're far apart. It uses IP addesses 
(kind of like street addresses) to figure out where the data needs to go. This layer helps route data through different networks, using routers to pass it along. If
the Dtat Link Layer is about talking to people in the same room, the Network Layer is like mailing a letter across the country to a friend.

Layer 4 - Transport Layer:

The Transport Layer makes sure data gets from one computer to another completely and in the right order. It breaks large pieces of data into smaller parts (called
segments) and reasembles them on the other side. This layer is also responsible for making sure nothing is missing or broken during delivery. Two common protocols
used here are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which checks for accuracy and resends lost pieces, and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which is faster but doesn't double-chece
check the data. Think of it like sending mail- TCP is like certified mail wwith tracking, and UDP is like regular mail that just gets dropped off.

Layer 5 - Session Layer:

The Session Layer helps two devices start, manage, and end a converstation or connection. It keeps track of who is talking and make sure the communication
stays organized, especially when lots of data is being shared at once. If the connections gets interupted, this layer helps restart the session without losing all
the progress. It's kind of like being on a zoom call- it handles the setup, keeps the call going, and knows when to hang up.

Layer 6 - Presentation Layer:

The presentation layer is like a translator for computers. It makes sure the data being sent can be understood by the receiver, evenif the systems are different.
This layer handles things lke file formats(PDF, JPEG) and encryption or decryption, so your data stays safe and makes sense when it gets to the other
side. It's what helps the computers talk dearly, even if they speak different "laguages".

Layer 7 - Application Layer:

The Application Layer is the top layer of the OSI Model and the one closest to users. This is where apps like web browsers, email. and messaging software
connect to the network. It's not the app itself, but the layer that makes netwrok services available to the app. For example, when you open Google Chrome
and go to a website, this layer handles the HTTP request to load the page. It supports things like file trnasfers, emails, and remote logins. Some protocols
used in this layer include HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.,
