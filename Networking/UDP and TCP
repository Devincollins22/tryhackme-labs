Transport Layer Notes (TCP/IP Model)
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
    - Connectionless and faster
    - No delivery confirmation or reliability
    - Common for streaming, DNS, and VoIP.
    - Uses port numbers (1-65535) to identify processes.
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
    - Connection- oriented and reliable 
    - Uses a three-way handshake (SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK) to establish connection
    - Ensures ordered delivery with sequence numbers and acknowledgements.
    - Common for HTTP, HTTPA, FTP, and email.
- Port Numbers:
    - Range from 1 to 65535 (2 Octets)
    - Port 0 is reserved
    - Help differentiate between mutipleservices on the same host
